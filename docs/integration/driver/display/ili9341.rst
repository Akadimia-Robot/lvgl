ILI9341 LCD Controller driver
=============================

Overview
-------------

The `ILI9341 <https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf>`__ SOC is a popular TFT LCD controller chip made by Ilitek. It supports TFT LCD panels with a maximum resolution of 240x320 pixels, and 262k (18 bit) colors.
It supports both serial and parallel interfaces, including 3/4 line SPI, 8080 type 8/9/16/18 bit parallel, or 6/16/18 bit RGB interfaces. The chip includes display RAM,
various voltage and timing generators. It has a MIPI DCS compatible register set.

The ILI9341 LCD controller `driver <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/src/dev/display/ili9341>`__ is a platform-agnostic driver. It implements display initialization,
supports display rotation and implements the display flush callback. The user needs to implement only two platform-specific functions to send
a command or pixel data to the controller via SPI or parallel bus. Typically these are implemented by calling the appropriate SDK library functions on the given platform.

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no prerequisites.

Configuring the driver
----------------------

Enable the ILI9341 driver support in lv_conf.h, by cmake compiler define or by KConfig

.. code:: c

	#define LV_USE_ILI9341  1

Usage
-----

You need to implement two platform-dependent functions:

.. code:: c

	/* Send short command to the LCD. This function shall wait until the transaction finishes. */
	int32_t my_lcd_send_cmd(lv_display_t *disp, uint8_t *cmd, size_t cmd_size, uint8_t *param, size_t param_size)
	{
		...
	}

	/* Send large array of pixel data to the LCD. If necessary, this function has to do the byte-swapping. This function can do the transfer in the background. */
	int32_t my_lcd_send_color(lv_display_t *disp, uint8_t *cmd, size_t cmd_size, uint8_t *param, size_t param_size)
	{
		...
	}

The only difference between the ``my_lcd_send_cmd()`` and ``my_lcd_send_color()`` functions is that ``my_lcd_send_cmd()`` is used to send short commands and it is expected
complete the transaction when it returns (in other words, it should be blocking), while ``my_lcd_send_color()`` is only used to send pixel data, and it is recommended to use
DMA to transmit data in the background. More sophisticated methods can be also implemented, like queing transfers and scheduling them in the background.

Please note that while display flushing is handled by the driver, it is the user's responsibility to call ``lv_display_flush_ready()``
when the color transfer completes. In case of a DMA transfer this is usually done in a transfer ready callback.

.. note::
	While it is acceptable to use a blocking implementation for the pixel transfer as well, performance will suffer.

.. tip::
	Care must be taken to avoid sending a command while there is an active transfer going on in the background. It is the user's responsibility to implement this either
	by polling the hardware, polling a global variable (which is reset at the end of the transfer), or by using a semaphore or other locking mechanism.

Please also note that the driver does not handle the draw buffer allocation, because this may be platform-dependent, too. Thus you need to allocate the buffers and assign them
to the display object as usual by calling ``lv_display_set_draw_buffers()``.

The driver can be used to create multiple displays. In such a configuration the callbacks must be able to distinguish between the displays. Usually one would
implement a separate set of callbacks for each display. Also note that the user must take care of arbitrating the bus when multiple devices are connected to it.

Example
-------

.. code:: c

	#include "src/dev/display/ili9341/lv_ili9341.h"

	int main(int argc, char ** argv)
	{
		...

		/* Initialize LVGL */
		lv_init();

		/* Initialize LCD bus I/O */
		if (my_lcd_io_init() != 0)
			return;

		/* Create the LVGL display object and the LCD display driver */
		lv_display_t * my_disp = lv_ili9341_create(320, 240, 0, my_lcd_send_cmd, my_lcd_send_color);

		/* Configure draw buffers, etc. */

		...

		while(true) {
			...

			/* Periodically call the lv_timer handler */
			lv_timer_handler();
		}
	}

Advanced topics
---------------

Create flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third argument of the ``lv_ili9341_create()`` function is a flag array. This can be used to configure the orientation and RGB ordering of the panel if the default settings
do not work for you. In particular, the ILI9341 driver accepts the following flags:

.. code:: c

	#define LV_LCD_FLAG_NONE                                0x00000000UL
	#define LV_LCD_FLAG_MIRROR_X                            0x00000001UL
	#define LV_LCD_FLAG_MIRROR_Y                            0x00000002UL
	#define LV_LCD_FLAG_BGR                                 0x00000008UL

You can pass multiple flags by ORing them together, e.g., ``LV_LCD_FLAG_MIRROR_X | LV_LCD_FLAG_BGR``.

Custom command lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the driver does its best to initialize the LCD controller correctly, it is possible, that different TFT panels need different configurations. In particular a correct gamma
setup is crucial for good color reproduction. Unfortunately, finding a good set of parameters is not easy. Usually the manufacturer of the panel provides some example code
with recommended register settings.

You can use the ``my_lcd_send_cmd()`` function to send an arbitrary command to the LCD controller. To make it easier to send a large number of parameters the driver supports sending
a custom command list to the controller. The commands must be put into a 'uint8_t' array:

.. code:: c

	static const uint8_t init_cmd_list[] = {
		<command 1>, <number of parameters>, <parameter 1>, ... <parameter N>,
		<command 2>, <number of parameters>, <parameter 1>, ... <parameter N>,
		...
		LV_LCD_CMD_DELAY_MS, LV_LCD_CMD_EOF		
	};
	
	...

	lv_ili9341_send_cmd_list(my_disp, init_cmd_list);
	
You can add a delay between the commands by using the pseudo-command ``LV_LCD_CMD_DELAY_MS``, which must be followed by the delay given in 10ms units.
To terminate the command list use a delay with a value of ``LV_LCD_CMD_EOF``, as shown above.

See an actual example `here <https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/src/dev/display/ili9341/lv_ili9341.c>`__.
