There are several ways to get your feet wet with LVGL. Here is one
recommended order of documents to read and things to play with while you
are learning to use LVGL:

1. If you haven't already done so, start with :ref:`introduction` page of the documentation (5 minutes).
2. Check out the `Online Demos <https://lvgl.io/demos>`__ to see LVGL in action (3 minutes).
3. Read the :ref:`quick-overview` page of the documentation (15 minutes).
4. Set up an LVGL :ref:`simulator` (10 minutes).
5. Have a look at some :ref:`examples` and their code.
6. Add LVGL to your project.  See the :ref:`porting` guide or check the ready to use
   `Projects <https://github.com/lvgl?q=lv_port_&type=&language=>`__.
7. Read the :ref:`overview` page to get a better understanding of the library. (2-3 hours)
8. Skim the documentation of :ref:`widgets` to see what is available.
9. If you have questions go to the `Forum <http://forum.lvgl.io/>`__.
10. Read the :ref:`contributing` guide to see how you can help to improve LVGL. (15 minutes)
